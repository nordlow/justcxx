 * List of FTP Commands
 * - The \c MLST and \c MLSD commands are intended to standardize the
 *   file and directory information returned by the server-FTP
 *   process.  These commands differ from the \c LIST command in that
 *   the format of the replies is strictly defined although
 *   extensible. Time is given in UTC.
 * - \c MDTM (with extension to set date and UTC time)
 * - \c SIZE
 * - \c XCRC, \c XMD5, \c XSHA1
