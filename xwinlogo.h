 * Draw the "official" X Window System Logo, designed by Danny Chong

 * Written by Ollie Jones, Apollo Computer
 *
 * Does some fancy stuff to make the logo look acceptable even

 * the logo line up as well as possible considering rasterization.

 * Munged to draw anti-aliased logo using Render extension.
